Hey guys,
After a lot of googling, going back to previous courses and having a good look at the code of fellow students....
I came up with this.
It works!
Though it's probably the most elaborate code someone has ever written for suuch a silly game! HAHAHA
Long live the ODIN Project!
Thank you all!
Hit me up on discord if you want to comment.
